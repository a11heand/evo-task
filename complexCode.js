Description: This code demonstrates a complex algorithm for generating a mathematical sequence called the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones.
The code calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms.

// Other sophisticated and complex code could be added below this point...
